% PARAGRAPH ONE OF THE PROPOSAL SHOULD:

% - Identify the name of the author and the title of the major text to be studied ( choose either Kafka OR Cliff)
% - Identify the key topic or issue to be explored in the context of the text
% - Include a thesis statement (1-2 sentences in length). This statement offers an original and contestable claim (e.g., not the sky is blue, but a claim which is debatable and which requires supporting evidence from the main text). This claim should not simply replicate one made in the secondary literary criticism you have read
% - Provide justification for this thesis (e.g., suggest why you are pursuing it)
% - Indicate, generally, how you will support the thesis (methodology)
% - The first paragraph must be written in complete sentences

% PARAGRAPH TWO OF THE PROPOSAL SHALL BE THE OUTLINE AND SHALL:

% - Sketch a summary of how you plan to structure the essay
% - Identify KEY CLAIMS that you plan to make
% - Identify PRIMARY SUPPORTING EVIDENCE (e.g., examples of evidence).
% - Provide a few key quotations with page references.

A strict analysis of Franz Kafka's \citetitle{kafka2007meta} yields an
interesting story of a family, and their struggles dealing with Gregor's
transformation into a cockroach. Specifically, the Samsa family has to make
a choice in between Gregor, who is proving to be quite the burden on the
family, and themselves. As a result of the transformation into a bug, Gregor
is subjected to the abuses of isolation from the family unit because he has
now become an burden on the family rather than a bread winner, which the
family and others looks poorly upon. I will explore the struggle of Gregor's
sister Grete
% DESCRIBE SOME STUFF HERE
in order to highlight Gregor's complete transition into
isolation, and later suicide. This raises the issue regarding the importance
of interaction within the context of this novella. Isolation from one's
family unit has the potential to be extremely damaging to ones health.

% Gregor's sister, Grete, shows great concern at the begining of the novel,
% but her reason is unclear. When Gregor wouldn't come out of his room, he
% concerned of why ``was she crying? Because he wouldn't get up and admit the
% chief clerk, because he was in danger of losing his job''
% \cite[95-96]{kafka2007meta}. At this point, it seemed like Gregor was
% thinking that his sister was more concerned for him losing his job rather
% than for himself. Even the chief clerk declared that he was just causing his
% parents ``grave and needless anxiety'' \cite[96]{kafka2007meta}.

Gregor's sister, Grete, undergoes a transformation herself, her perspective
of her brother and role in the family changes. Grete, from her well-being
nature of going through the effort of bringing him different food to find
what he would like. Even Gregor was surprised by this, exclaiming that
``never would he have been able to guess what in the goodness of her heart
his sister did'' \cite[109]{kafka2007meta}.
% This then degrading to her <- SOME INTRO HERE
 ``[n]o longer bothering to think what might please Gregor, his sister [...]
now hurriedly shoved some food or other into Gregor's room with her foot''
\cite[130]{kafka2007meta}. We can also look at her attitude discussing
Gregor with the rest of the family.
% Often discussing <- CHANGE TO SOMETHING ELSE
the remark relating to
his food consumption as ``[having] a good appetite today'' or ``hardly been
touched today'' \cite[111, 111]{kafka2007meta}. Discussing the remainder of
the characters in the family as well will prove useful.

% WHOLE PARAGRAPH NEEDS WORK
Using Carol Cantrell's article \citetitle{cantrellFamily}, I will focus on
the change in the family structure as a result of Gregor's transformation.
His sense of duty is made clear right at the beginning of the book,
\citeauthor{cantrellFamily} remarking that ``his desire to sleep a little
longer is an implicit threat to the rest of the family''
\cite[581]{cantrellFamily}. The analysis by \citeauthor{cantrellFamily}
regarding Gregor's view of the family, and how Gregor becomes ``free to
think ill or even indifferently of his family'' \cite[585]{cantrellFamily}
because he is dying.

% EXPAND EXPAND EXPAND!
With the use of Michael Rowe's \citetitle{rowe2002}, I will focus on the
relationships drawn with how Gregor's now bug state has changed his families
view of him.
